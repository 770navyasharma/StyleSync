Problem Statement
In the modern era of e-commerce and digital fashion, customers face challenges in visualizing how clothes will look on them before making a purchase. Traditional methods like model-based product displays or size charts often fail to provide a personalized experience, leading to high return rates and customer dissatisfaction.
This project aims to develop a real-time virtual try-on system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging HR-VITON, OpenPose, and DensePose, the system will allow users to see how different clothing items fit them through a live video feed. This will enhance the shopping experience, reduce uncertainty in online purchases, and minimize return rates, benefiting both customers and retailers.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Diffusion-Based Virtual Try-On System that allows users to visualize clothing on themselves realistically. Unlike traditional GAN-based methods, diffusion models provide high-quality image synthesis, preserving fine details, textures, and clothing alignment. This ensures that garments fit naturally on different body shapes while maintaining their original structure and appearance.
Our approach integrates human parsing, pose estimation, and deformable transformation to accurately adapt clothing to a person’s posture. By leveraging the iterative denoising process of diffusion models, we aim to minimize artifacts and improve realism, making virtual try-on experiences more seamless and practical for e-commerce, fashion, and retail applications.

Methodology
Real-Time Frame Capture – Captures video or webcam frames and selects a clear frame for processing.
Preprocessing (DensePose & Segmentation) – Extracts human pose and segments the person and garment for better garment warping.
Garment Feature Extraction (GarmentNet) – Identifies texture, shape, and fabric details for realistic draping.
High-Level Semantic Encoding (IP-Adapter) – Encodes garment semantics to guide the diffusion model for a natural fit.
IDM-VTON Try-On Generation – Uses a diffusion-based approach to generate realistic try-on images while preserving details.
Occlusion Handling & Refinement – Adjusts for self-occlusions, ensuring smooth garment transitions and eliminating distortions.
Post-Processing & Enhancement – Applies final touch-ups like color correction, shadow blending, and sharpening for realism.

Project Modules:  Design/Algorithm
Step 1: Real-Time Frames Capturing
Live video feed is captured using OpenCV.
Each frame undergoes background removal using MediaPipe/SAM to retain only the user.
This ensures real-time processing without unnecessary background interference.

Step 2: Pose Detection and Segmentation
Background Background Removal: Extracts the user from the background using SAM/MediaPipe.
Pose Estimation: Utilizes OpenPose and DensePose to detect body landmarks.
Segmentation: Identifies body regions for accurate cloth placement.
Cloth Segmentation: Extracts and aligns clothing images for a natural fit.

Step 3: Garment Feature Extraction (GarmentNet)
Garment Parsing & Segmentation: Identifies and segments garment regions from the reference clothing image.
Texture & Fabric Feature Extraction: Captures fine-grained details like wrinkles, patterns, and material properties.
Shape & Deformation Learning: Analyzes garment shape variations to adapt to different body structures.

Step 4: High-Level Semantic Encoding (IP-Adapter)
Semantic Feature Learning: Encodes high-level garment attributes (style, category, structure) into latent space.
Diffusion Model Guidance: Uses extracted features to condition the IDM-VTON model for realistic garment alignment.
Pose & Context Awareness: Ensures the try-on result aligns with human pose and preserves realistic proportions.
Cross-Modal Feature Fusion: Integrates garment information with person image features for seamless blending.
Step 5: IDM-VTON Try-On Generation
Diffusion-Based Image Synthesis: Generates realistic try-on results through iterative refinement.
Pose & Garment Adaptation: Aligns the garment naturally onto the target person while preserving texture details.
Handling Occlusions & Deformations: Corrects distortions due to body movements, folds, or overlapping elements.
Multi-Step Refinement: Iteratively refines garment fitting for high-quality and photorealistic results.
